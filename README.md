# Virtual-Hospital-Receptionist
A virtual hospital receptionist that can manage the queue, inform the doctors about the waiting patients, send a note from patients to the doctor, alert emergencies etc.

Stage 1:
  - Came up with the VIRTUAL HOSPITAL RECEPTIONIST idea and laid out a framework for implementing it as a webapp that can be used by hospitals.
  - Tools I have used are Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML and CSS.
